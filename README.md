This repository contains the **Arduino** codes, **Proteus** simulations and **Fritzing** designs for multiple approaches to fullfil the requirements of the third topic of the final project delivered for the *Measurement Systems and Instrumentation* course lectured by *Dr. Moosa Ayati*.

## Design, Production, Implementation, and Calibration of Capacitive Proximity Sensor for Liquid Level Measurement

This project, as a collaborative work of a group of 5 mechanical engineering students is concerned about:
- Optimization of sensor design for high precision and sensitivity in liquid level detection.
- Accurate calibration ensuring reliable performance across various liquid types and conditions.
- Integration of the designed system with *Arduino Uno* board to create a realâ€‘world prototype.
